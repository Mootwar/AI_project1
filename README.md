# AI_project1
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive machine learning model, analyze its biases, and propose mitigation strategies to improve fairness. Students will work with real-world datasets, apply data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and fairness assessment techniques while maintaining ethical AI considerations.
